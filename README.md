# doctalk
DocTalk is an offline document-to-speech converter that transforms Markdown and EPUB files into natural-sounding audio using Edge TTS engine. It runs locally without cloud services, making it ideal for creating audiobooks and processing sensitive documents while maintaining privacy.


# requirements
As audioop is removed from python 3.13, ffmpeg is required for a better compatibility. Please install ffmpeg before using doctalk.
